## add a mount entry for each mount point to be managed by mountd

# The 'mount_point' field for USB mass storage devices under volume_usb
# or volume_usb2 represents the base mount point directory and the default 
# mount point name (when a mass storage device has no volume label).
# For example, if the mount_point is specified as /X/Y/Z/A, then 
# '/X/Y/Z' represents the mount location, and 'A' represents the 
# default mount point name if a device without volume label was inserted.
#
# If a directory in the mount point path is not present, it will be created 
# provided the parent directories have write permission.
